# OCaML-Checkers

##### Project by Adam Skrocki, Austin Li, Jennifer Lee, and Ellaine Chou

A command line checkers game programmed in OCaml using only standard OCaml modules. Users have the option to play against another player on the same computer, another player on a different
computer, or an AI opponent of several difficulties. The AI opponent uses an alpha-beta pruning algorrithm and a simple weighted piece count for its evaluation heuristic. The multi-computer play uses sockets from the Unix module and the user interface uses ANSITerminal.
